This project aims at classifying the Rattus norvegicus based on their USVs. 
This is done by training neural networks using transfer learning. 
The models used for transfer learning are: ResNet50 and adapted DeepSqueak models: YOLO and long YOLO.

To pre-process the audio that is in tar files, run process_tar_files.py.

To run all the experiments, run the run_experiments.py file

Both are located in the methodology folder.
